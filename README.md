ChatGPT summary:
The "Match Spatial Logger" is a web application designed to track and record spatial events during a match. Presented with a grid layout resembling specific locations on a pitch, users can incrementally log events by clicking on individual buttons corresponding to the 12 designated areas. Each button press increments a counter displayed on the button, allowing for an intuitive visual representation of accumulated events. For post-match analysis, users can export the logged data into a timestamped CSV file with a single click. Additionally, a reset functionality is provided to clear all counters. The user interface, optimized for both mobile and desktop viewing, displays each button with a unique background image representing its respective location, ensuring clear visual distinction. Hover effects on the export and reset buttons provide feedback, enhancing user experience.
